#FaceMaskDetection_YOLO8

#About the Project
This algorithm is for face mask detection task through training the state-of-the-art YOLOv8. The training and testing datasets bounding box annotation is in YOLO format. I have trained both YOLOv8 medium and nano models to check the best results which is achieved through training medium model. 
More information about the algorithm is explained below.
