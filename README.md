<h1> FaceMaskDetection_YOLO8

## About the Project
This algorithm is for face mask detection task through training the state-of-the-art YOLOv8. The training and testing datasets bounding box annotation is in YOLO format. I have trained both YOLOv8 medium and nano models to check the best results which is achieved through training medium model. 
More information about the algorithm is explained below.
  
## Requirements
  1. PyTorch version==1.7
  2. ultralytics for YOLOv8
  3. yolov8m.pt (medium) or yolov8n.pt (nano) model
  4. OpenCV (cv2)
  5. natsort library
  
  
 ## File Description
  Download ultralics and yolov8m&n models from https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
   Run main.ipnb jupyter notebook
